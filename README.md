ex00:
Modify the string of each data. 
Allowed functions: none

ex01:
Write a script that formats the dates this specific way.
Allowed functions: time, datetime or any other library that allows to receive the date

ex02:
Write a function that prints the object types and returns 42.
Use tester.py
Allowed functions: none

ex03:
Write a function that prints the object type of all types of "Null".
Return 0 if it goes well and 1 in case of error.
Use tester.py
Allowed functions: none

ex04:
Create a script that takes a number as argument, checks whether it is odd or even and prints the result.
If more than one argument is provided or if the argument is not an integer, print an AssertionError.
Allowed functions: sys or any other library that allows to receive the args

ex05:
Make a program, with a main, which takes a single string argument and displays the sums of its upper-case characters, lower-case characters, punctuation characters, digits and spaces.
• If None or nothing is provided, the user is prompted to provide a string.
• If more than one argument is provided to the program, print an AssertionError.
• The carriage return counts as a space, if you don’t want to return one use ctrl + D.
Allowed functions: sys or any other library that allows to receive the args

ex06:
Part 1: Recode your own ft_filter, it should behave like the original built-in function (it should return the same thing as "print(filter.__doc__)"), you should use list comprehensions to recode your ft_filter.
Part 2: Create a program that accepts two arguments: a string(S), and an integer(N). The program should output a list of words from S that have a length greater than N.
• Words are separated from each other by space characters.
• Strings do not contain any special characters. (Punctuation or invisible)
• The program must contain at least one list comprehension expression and one lambda.
• If the number of argument is different from 2, or if the type of any argument is wrong, the program prints an AssertionError.
Allowed functions: sys or any other library that allows to receive the args

ex07:
Make a program that takes a string as an argument and encodes it into Morse Code.
• The program supports space and alphanumeric characters
• An alphanumeric character is represented by dots . and dashes -
• Complete morse characters are separated by a single space
• A space character is represented by a slash /
You must use a dictionary to store your morse code.
If the number of arguments is different from 1, or if the type of any argument is wrong, the program prints an AssertionError.
Allowed functions: sys or any other library that allows to receive the args

ex08:
Create a function called ft_tqdm. The function must copy the function tqdm with the yield operator.
Allowed functions: none

ex09:
Allowed functions: PyPI or any library for creation package
